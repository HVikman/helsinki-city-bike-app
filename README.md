## Installation

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HVikman/helsinki-city-bike-app.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd helsinki-city-bike-app/backend

   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory.
   - Specify the required environment variables in the .env file. Refer to .env.example for the list of variables.

5. Create a MySQL database for the backend:

   - Make sure you have a MySQL database server installed and running.

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Log in to the MySQL server using the command:
  ```bash
  mysql -u your_username -p
  ```
- Create a new database
  ```mysql
  CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
  ```
- Exit mysql
  ```mysql
  EXIT;
  ```

6. Import database

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < create_db.sql
   ```

7. Start backend
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   Backend will be running at http://localhost:4000 unless different port is specified in .env file.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd helsinki-city-bike-app/frontend

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install

- <https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-06.csv>
- <https://dev.hsl.fi/citybikes/od-trips-2021/2021-07.csv>

2. Download dataset that has information about Helsinki Region Transportâ€™s (HSL) city bicycle stations.

I have created quite a lot of tests for the frontend. You can run tests by:

1.  ```bash
    cd frontend

    ```

2.  ```bash
    npm test

    ```

3.  All tests should pass

### Backend tests

There is only few backend tests, but you can run them:
